## Usage


### Images
All images in the public/images/dinos folder are images of the (stickers found on the official Paleo Pines shop)[
https://paleopines.myshopify.com/collections/stickers] that I edited to make the backgrounds transparent.
All images in the other subfolders of public/images were created by me by editing in-game screenshots.
I do not own these images; all rights belong to Italic Pig/Maximum Entertainment/the sticker artists.

The exception is public/images/Dreamstone.png, which I drew by tracing a screenshot of a dreamstone found on the (wiki)[https://paleo-pines.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamstone] in a smiliar style to the stickers.
